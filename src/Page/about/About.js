                <h3>
                    I first arrived in Canada when I was fourteen years old, and my parents chose Canada for me in order to have a better environment to study and live in. But they couldn't come to live here with me because they had work to do. I remember when I first arrived in Canada, it was February and it was still snowing heavily. Looking out the window at the snowflakes, I was lost. I was in a very unfamiliar environment and I did not have the ability to live on my own at that time, so it was important to find a homestay family.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    In Canada, I met many international students, many of whom, like me, had come to Canada at a very young age. For us, a good homestay family can bring us a special number of things. Some of us have met great homestay families who take us on trips together, go to church on weekends, and talk to our host moms when we are sad alone. Others have met bad host families, even those who don't have enough to eat, don't get a good diet, and don't care about the children, but just want to make money.
                </h3>
                <h1 className="text-box-title">Why Home_Stay Info?</h1>
                <h3>
                    Because homestay families are a minority group, many people don't know about them and don't know how to find a good homestay family. I hope to help more people find a suitable host family by creating HomeStayInfo website, because parents who can't grow up with their children need to find a good and responsible guardian. When children are studying abroad alone, they can get timely help in case of difficulties!
